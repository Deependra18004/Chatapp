# ChatApp

Welcome to the ChatApp repository! This project showcases the application of RSA and public-private encryption in a simple chat application.

## Features

- **RSA Encryption**: Secure your messages using RSA public and private keys.
- **Python Script**: A Python script is provided for encryption and decryption of messages.
- **Wireshark**: You can use Wireshark to verify that your messages are encrypted.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python
- **Encryption**: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

## Usage

1. **Generate Keys**: Use the provided Python script to generate RSA public and private keys.
    ```bash
    python generate_keys.py
    ```

2. **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages**: Use the script to encrypt and decrypt your messages.
    ```bash
    python encrypt.py "Your message here"
    python decrypt.py "Your encrypted message here"
    ```
